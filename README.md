## Setup

This site is build with Middleman, a static site generator using all the shortcuts and tools in modern web development. Middleman is distributed using the RubyGems package manager. This means you will need both the Ruby language runtime installed and RubyGems to begin using Middleman.

Once you have Ruby and RubyGems up and running, execute the following from the command line:

```bash
$ gem install middleman
```

This will install Middleman, its dependencies and the command-line tools for using Middleman.

The installation process will add one new command to your environment, with three useful features:

```bash
$ middleman init
$ middleman server
$ middleman build
```
